<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The "shell" is a command-line interface (CLI) that serves as an interpreter for interacting with the operating system's services. It provides a text-based interface, allowing users to input commands and receive output. The term "shell" can also refer to a scripting environment that facilitates task automation through shell scripts.

This project is a simulation of the Simple Shell.
